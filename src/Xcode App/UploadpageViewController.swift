/* This class deals with the Upload Function in the Library/Bookshelf.
 This upload function will access the user's iCloud Drive, takes a .epub file and sends it to our server.
 Our server will run the Watson Tone Analyser and assign a BGM to each page.
 Our server will also identify difficult words and provide them with pop-ups containing their meanings.
 The server will then send the new file back to the user's app, in the form of a book in the Library/Bookshelf page.
